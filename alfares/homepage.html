<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>How to avoid the failure of the Carrier air conditioner</strong></span><br>
<strong>Air conditioners are devices that are subjected to sudden breakdowns due to their use in the summer and not using them in the winter season. This leads to the accumulation of dust and dust and affects the increase of breakdowns inside it.</strong><br>
<strong> AL-Fares Air Conditioning service advises that the air conditioner undergoes comprehensive periodic maintenance to face these breakdowns, not to stop suddenly, and to work continuously and efficiently.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:  #f9fbff;"><strong>Air conditioning malfunctions?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:  #f9fbff;"><strong>Evaporator stopped working:</strong></span><br>
<strong>Because of corrosion in the engine or the presence of something that impedes the movement of the fan and works to not operate the fan at the same capacity that it is due to anything that impedes or others, it must be inspected and contact AL-Fares Air Conditioning maintenance team</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>The filter is dirty?</strong></span><br>
<strong>First of all, no matter what type of air conditioner you have, the clogged filter restricts airflow, reduces efficiency and reduces the ability to effectively cool the air. Secondly, if you did not clean the filter in your window or portable air conditioner recently, make sure to check it periodically, it must be cleaned of dust and sediments that may affect its efficiency or lead to complete damage over time, I will give you advice just keep in mind that If your system is constantly running or if you have pets, you will need to change your filters more.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>Is it too sunny inside?</strong></span><br>
<strong>If your window conditioner is in a window that displays direct sunlight in the heat of the day, it will have to work harder to cool your space. If you have a choice, move it to a darker place. If not, always make sure to close all air outlets and block the sunlight when operating the air conditioner device to keep it safe from damage and to ensure a high level of cooling and high sun heat works to stop the cooling and hear sound in the compressor, which increases the pressure due to the sun that shed Accordingly, the malfunctions result from the sound of this air conditioner, so it must stop working and communicate with the AL-Fares Air Conditioning maintenance team.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>Sudden pause or sound inside?</strong></span><br>
<strong>In this case, the device must stop working because it does not get cold and fresh air due to water leakage from the air conditioner due to a blockage in the Carrier air conditioner due to not being wired and these deposits accumulate inside the air conditioner when doing the cooling process during which the air is purified and work to accumulate The sediments inside the hose must be cleaned or changed</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>Is the warm air leaking?</strong></span><br>
<strong>Check the connections around your window conditioner to ensure that the hot air does not enter (or that the cold air does not leak). Reseat around your unit if necessary.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>Is your window shaking?</strong></span><br>
<strong>Air conditioners make a lot of noise, including fan noise and compressor rotation sound on and off. These sounds are normal. But if you hear a vibrating noise, it may mean that your unit is incorrectly installed. Ensure that he sits safely in the window and review the installation instructions in the owner’s manual to ensure that no steps are missed.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>Is the thermostat in the correct position?</strong></span><br>
<strong>If the temperature appears to be off, make sure that the thermostat is not exposed to direct sunlight, which may cause the wrong temperature to be recorded.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>Are trees crowded around the compressor?</strong></span><br>
<strong>The external compressor of the central air needs sufficient air flow to work properly, so make sure there is a distance of at least 2 to 3 feet between the compressor and any plants, structures or trees.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #f9fbff;"><strong>Do you remember the annual examination of the device?</strong></span><br>
<strong>You can check your device with the technician through the AL-Fares Air Conditioning Maintenance Center and discover any serious problems before they get worse. The technician will check all the moving parts as well as the coolant and recharge the system if necessary.</strong></p>
